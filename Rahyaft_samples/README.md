In collaboration with the client company's project management office (PMO), several dashboards
were created for analyzing and calculating the budget spent compared to the plan. If the project was
more than 5% behind the time schedule or exceeding the planned budget, it warned the client to
investigate this matter properly. Plus, the data collection process became automatic with 100%
ensured accuracy.
